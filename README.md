A program that converts a number to a string, the contents of which depends on the number’s prime factors. * If the number contains `3` as a prime factor, output `"Pling"`. * If the number contains `5` as a prime factor, output `"Plang"`. * If the number contains `7` as a prime factor, output `"Plong"`. * If the number does not contain `3`, `5`, or `7` as a prime factor, just pass the number’s digits straight through.
